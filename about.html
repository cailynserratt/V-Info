   	  	<p>What is a Vtuber?</p>
   	  	<p>A V-Tuber or Virtual YouTuber, is an online entertainer who uses a virtual avatar. Real-time motion capture is often- but not always- used to capture movement. This tend started in Japan in the mid 2010s but wasnâ€™t wildly popularized until 2020s when it grew on an international scale. While the name suggests that most use Youtube as their entertainment platform, many use different platforms such as Twitch, Bilibili and Niconico. Models come in both 2D and 3D forms where they are potraying the character created by an artist. V-Tubers are associated with Japanese popular culture and aesthetics, such as anime and manga. Some V-Tubers even choose avatars that are non-human such as animals. Many people choose to do this because of their own personal interests but many others do it to maintain their own personal privacy as well as their own safety while expressing themselves online however they please.</p>
